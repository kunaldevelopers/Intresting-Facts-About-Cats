## **Cats Facts Generator**

 - This is a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project that generates interesting facts about cats upon clicking a button. Users can also specify the number of facts they want to generate.

**How to Use**

 - 1. Save the HTML file (index.html) and the JavaScript file (apps.js) and the CSS file (style.css) in the same directory.
 - 2. Open the HTML file in a web browser.
 - 3. Click the "Generate" button to display a random cat fact.
 - 4. Enter a number in the prompt and click "Generate" again to display that many cat facts.
 - 5. Click the "Clear" button to clear the displayed facts and start over.

## **Project Structure**

* index.html: Contains the main HTML structure of the webpage.
* apps.js: Contains the JavaScript code that fetches cat facts from an API, handles user input, and updates the webpage. 
* style.css: Contains the CSS styles for the webpage.

**Dependencies**

* The project uses the [Cat Facts API](https://catfact.ninja/) to retrieve cat facts.

**I hope this README.md provides a clear understanding of the project!**
